    "Throwing out all the dreadful hierarchical diagrams from the early 1960s, researchers sought ways to model the ***true*** structure of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1976, an ideal approach was developed by **Peter Chen** in his paper Toward a Unified View of Data, *ACM Transactions on Database Systems, Volume 1, Number 1, March 1976* pp. 9-36.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Chen's paper he defined six terms **entity**, **entity set**, **relationship**, **cardinality**, **attribute**, **key attribute**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Entity** or simply **Entity** is \"something **in which we are interested**, that exists and which is **distinguishable** from other similar things\".  It is critical in developing a data model, that the model includes only things of interest and **ignores** things that are irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entity Set** is a \"collection of similar entities\" and how you define your entity set depends on your world view. It is easier to refer to an entity set as simply and **entity** except when an **instance** within an entity set has to be distinguished from another instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship** means \"an association between two or more entity sets\". For example a *student <u>is enrolled in</u> a course* or *a teacher <u>is teaching</u> a course*. Conceptually, it is possible to have three-way relationships, however, these can generally be expressed as two or more two-way relationships that are subsequently easier to model in DBD. Chen's model therefore express all relationships as two-way only.\n",
    " - It is possible, and quite common, to have a relationship between an entity set and itself. For example *a student <u>is a sibling of</u> another student*.\n",
    " - Acknowledging the existence of the above example relationship shows that you are interested in the fact that some students are siblings of other students and you want to record this in the DBD.\n",
    " - As with entities, it is important to limit the identification of relationships to those that are relevant in your world view.\n",
    " \n",
    "Another common example of a relationship is a **set-membership** or **generalization** relationship that is often referred to as an ***<u>is a</u>*** or **isa** relationship. For example, *student <u>is a</u> a university member*. In this example, university member is a more general entity set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cardinality** means \"for the entities at one end of a relationship, how many entities at the other end of the relationship can have that relationship to them\". There are three possible cardinalities: **one-to-one**, **one-to-many**, and **many-to-many**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attribute** means \"a property, in which we are interested, of the entities in an entity set\" or also \"a property of a relationship\". Be careful not to confuse an extrinsic detail about an entity as if it is an attribute of the entity.\n",
    " - In an E-R model, relationships, like entities, can have attributes (although they do not have to, whereas entities must have at least one attribute).\n",
    " \n",
    " **Key Attribute** are attributes that *uniquely identify an individual entity*.\n",
    "  - For an entity set to be represented in a DB, it is essential that one of its attributes, or a combination of two or more of its attributes, be designated as the key that will uniquely identify any individual entity in that entity set.\n",
    "  - An attribute that uniquely identifices an individual entity within an entity set.\n",

    " - There is nothing in the E-R model and its diagramming that prevents it from being used, and useful, in the context of non-relationship DBMSs.\n",
    " - When you use an E-R diagram as the starting point for doing relational DBD, everything falls into place so easily that the strength of the relational model is made that much more apparent.\n",

    "Translating an E-R diagram into the DB implementation requires you to:\n",
    "1. Create a table for every entity set, giving it a column for each attribute. Make sure that your key attribute(s) really work as a key.\n",
    "2. Create a table for each relationship, giving it a column for each of its own attribute(s) if there are any. Importantly, create columns for the key attributes of the two entity sets between which the relationship operates. The relationship's own attribute(s) will generally not be additional key attribute(s) of the relationship, but one of them might be.\n",
    "3. Examine the DBD to see if it is already normalized. If you spot a problem, it is generally solved by splitting entity tables into two or more tables and adding relationship tables as necessary.\n",
    "4. Don't be afraid to have tables with only one column, containing a single key attribute. This sort of table allows you to add all instances of the key attribute prior to adding other data elsewhere that relate to that key attribute.\n",
