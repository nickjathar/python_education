    "Simplification is possible and modern analysis tools allow us to formulate a simplified strategy that works.\n",
    " - The simplifciation described in CORE L1 gives up little in terms of profits relative to more complex strategies.\n",
    " - For relatively new players, being confronted with full GTO solutions would be completely overwhelming.\n",
    " \n",
    "In most GTO preflop simulatoins, you would want to raise more hands than those suggested in CORE L1. Why would CORE L1 recommend a stategy that is too tight?\n",
    " - It eliminates mistakes deeper in the hand. Some starting hands are simply more difficult to play for inexperienced players, and generate very little profit even if played well.\n",
    " - Simply removing these marginal hands actually increases the win-rate of beginning players.\n",
    " \n",
    "Almost every small-stakes game features overly-loose play.\n",
    " - The greater the cold calls and limps, the greater the looseness of play.\n",
    " - Cold calls and limps in GTO models shouldn't happen very often (open limps would never happen).\n",
    " - Overwhelming majority of preflop calls should happen only from the big blind.\n",
    " \n",
    "Preflop opens from early position will frequently get called by one or more players. Even though your calling opponents are the ones frequently making a mistake by doing so, you being out of position puts you on your heels.\n",
    " - The way to combat oponents in these types of games is to tighten up your preflop ranges relative to GTO.\n",
    " - The CORE L1 opening ranges are a deviation from GTO that combine for a perfect exploit of low-stakes games.\n",
    " - The main consequence of rampant looseness in a typical small-stakes game is that playing tight is a powerful exploitative play. You have to gauge your opponents **calling inelasticity**.\n",
    "   - It can provide a higher win-rate than if you applied perfect GTO ranges.\n",
    "   \n",
    "If good to aggressive raising preflop doesn't work in terms of isolating you to one opponent, then you have a to rethink you strategy. This is because multiple callers can make winning postflop tough.\n",
    " - When raising gets 3+ callers, limping becomes more viable (with the lower end of your raising range).\n",
    " - Use some discipline and logic when choosing your limp range (don't go bananas with complete trash).\n",
    " - Try large raising before limping.\n",
    " \n",
    "Addressing the issue of range balance\n",
    " - Constantly raising really strong stuff and limping with playable stuff creates a face-up situation as players pick up on your betting pattern. This creates an IMBALANCED range for you.\n",
    "   - This however is hard for good players that pick up on your betting pattern to exploit you because of the general overall looseness of the game.\n",
    "   - However, if the ratio of good players to loose weak players tilts towards good players, then your IMBALANCED range will begin to hurt you.\n",
    "   \n",
    "The last simplification you may want to consider as a relatively inexperienced player is reducing the amount of these ranges you attempt to memorize.\n",
    " - Initially, we suggest you only use the 100% raise-or-fold hands.\n",
    " - Going further, you could use the first early position (EP1) range as your range for every early position spot.\n",
    " - Similarly, you can use the lojack (LJ) range for both the LJ and HJ.\n",
    " - Finally you can use the button (BU) range for the small blind (SB).\n",
    " \n",
    "Strongly consider this if you find yourself making significant mistakes postflop, tilting frequently, or just having other areas of your game that need sustantial attention.\n",
    " - Precision in your exact preflop ranges will not help you as much as solving the above leaks first."
