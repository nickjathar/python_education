    "- Checking behind on the river completely terminates the hand and is good for hands wanting a showdown.\n",
    "- Checking behind on any street before the river results in a free card for you and your opponent and is good if the free card benefits you.\n",
    "  - This is especially true if you have a **weak hand and little fold equity** but could improve to the best hand.\n",
    "  - Often this happens in a multiway pot since the possibility of someone having a strong hand and planning to checkraise is higher.\n",
    "  - Checking to your opponents works well if they are aggressive and you want them to bet. In some situations, certain opponents will be a high percentage of the time. For example, some players almost always make a contiuation bet on the flop after raising preflop. **Remember those who do**. You can exploit them later by checking the flop when you do make a hand.\n",

    "- Good fold equity estimation requires putting your opponent on a range of hands and know something about how your opponent will play different hands in that range.\n",
    "- Additionally, categorizing your opponents style is critical. For example, a calling station may not folding the weak hand in his range whereas a weak-tight player make fold a stronger holding.\n",
